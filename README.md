## About the Video Course
Microservices in Go teaches you how to handle advanced server side development in Go; it uses microservices to accomplish this, but is relevant to all server-side developers.

This course is your one-stop guide to learn all about building cloud-native architectures in Go. We begin by introducing you to the cloud native stack and microservices, then move on to implementing a simple Go microservice. This includes implementing the REST API with Go’s standard library. Finally, we look at the Containerization and Orchestration of Go micro services using Docker and Kubernetes by showing you how to deploy Kubernetes and scale deployment.
